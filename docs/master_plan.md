## üìù Recent Progress

1. System Containerization (COMPLETED)
   - Successfully deployed all containers
   - Verified container health and connectivity
   - Established proper resource allocation
   - Configured networking

2. Test Generation Investigation (COMPLETED)
   - Analyzed requirement handling across system
   - Documented current capability format
   - Updated test templates and generators
   - Identified remaining integration points

3. Documentation Updates
   - Enhanced configuration_management.md with requirement format
   - Updated template_system.md with test generation details
   - Added troubleshooting information to testing_and_improvements.md
   - Consolidated findings in master_plan.md

4. Test Generation Fixes and Version Control Updates
   - Updated test_generator.py to handle both dictionary and string format requirements
   - Added TestAgent configuration to agents.yaml for testing requirement validation
   - Modified .gitignore to allow tracking of private/config files
   - Committed and pushed changes with detailed commit message
   - Improved error handling for requirement verification
   - Added comprehensive test cases for requirement validation

5. Projects API and Frontend Implementation (COMPLETED)
   - Backend Improvements:
     * Fixed project_metadata column naming issue
     * Added proper datetime handling with non-null constraints
     * Created migration scripts for schema updates
     * Improved error handling and validation
     * Added proper relationship handling with agents
   - Frontend Development:
     * Created Projects component with Material-UI
     * Implemented CRUD operations with TypeScript
     * Added project metadata display and management
     * Enhanced form validation and error handling
     * Updated API service to match backend changes
   - Testing Setup:
     * Added MSW configuration for frontend tests
     * Updated test setup with required polyfills
     * Improved error handling in API service

## üéØ Next Actions

1. Frontend Testing and Integration
   - Complete MSW setup with node-fetch polyfills
   - Add test cases for Projects component
   - Verify frontend-backend integration
   - Test error handling and validation
   - Document component usage

2. System Deployment (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Run full test suite to verify fixes
   - Deploy updated system with new requirement handling
   - Monitor system performance
   - Begin agent interactions
   - Document any issues encountered

3. Regression Testing
   - Run comprehensive test suite
   - Verify requirement inheritance chain
   - Test all capability interactions
   - Monitor system stability
   - Document test results

The system has a working projects API with frontend integration, but requires completion of frontend testing setup. The next chat session should focus on completing the MSW setup and implementing test cases for the Projects component.
