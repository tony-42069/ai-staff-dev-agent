## 🐛 Known Issues

1. Test Generation System
   - Issue: Test generation fails with KeyError: 'requirement'
   - Root Cause: Mismatch between capability configuration structure and test template expectations
   - Impact: 
     * Unable to generate proper test cases for agents
     * Blocks proper validation of agent capabilities
     * Prevents automated testing of new features
   - Progress Made:
     * Identified that capabilities.yaml already uses correct structured format
     * Updated test_generator.py to handle structured requirements
     * Updated test_agent.py.template for proper requirement access
     * Attempted migration tool approach (not needed as format was correct)
   - Current Status:
     * Still encountering 'requirement' error despite format fixes
     * Need to investigate agent class implementation
   - Next Steps:
     * Review agent class requirement handling
     * Ensure capability class properly exposes requirements
     * Add validation for requirement access patterns
     * Create comprehensive test suite for requirement handling

## 📝 Recent Progress

1. System Containerization (COMPLETED)
   - Successfully deployed all containers
   - Verified container health and connectivity
   - Established proper resource allocation
   - Configured networking

2. Test Generation Investigation (IN PROGRESS)
   - Analyzed requirement handling across system
   - Documented current capability format
   - Updated test templates and generators
   - Identified remaining integration points

3. Documentation Updates
   - Enhanced configuration_management.md with requirement format
   - Updated template_system.md with test generation details
   - Added troubleshooting information to testing_and_improvements.md
   - Consolidated findings in master_plan.md

## 🎯 Next Actions

1. Fix Test Generation System (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Review agent class requirement handling
   - Verify capability class implementation
   - Test requirement inheritance chain
   - Add comprehensive validation
   - Create regression test suite

2. System Deployment
   - Complete test generation fixes
   - Run full test suite
   - Deploy updated system
   - Monitor performance
   - Begin agent interactions

The system is containerized and operational, but requires test generation fixes before proceeding with agent deployment. The next chat session should focus on investigating the agent class implementation and requirement handling.
