# AI Staff Development Agent - Master Plan

[Previous content remains the same until Known Issues section...]

## üêõ Known Issues

1. Test Generation System (COMPLETED)
   - Issue: Test generation fails with KeyError: 'requirement'
   - Root Cause: Mismatch between capability configuration structure and test template expectations
   - Impact: 
     * Unable to generate proper test cases for agents
     * Blocks proper validation of agent capabilities
     * Prevents automated testing of new features
   - Resolution:
     * Added RequirementModel class for structured requirement handling
     * Updated capability class to properly handle requirement dictionaries
     * Modified agent class to use requirement model structure
     * Fixed test templates and generation to work with new requirement format
     * Ensured consistent requirement handling across system components
     * Committed and pushed changes with comprehensive test updates
   - Current Status:
     * Issue resolved with proper requirement handling structure
     * Test generation system now working as expected
     * Ready for system deployment phase

## üìù Recent Progress

1. System Containerization (COMPLETED)
   - Successfully deployed all containers
   - Verified container health and connectivity
   - Established proper resource allocation
   - Configured networking

2. Test Generation Investigation (COMPLETED)
   - Analyzed requirement handling across system
   - Documented current capability format
   - Updated test templates and generators
   - Identified remaining integration points

3. Documentation Updates
   - Enhanced configuration_management.md with requirement format
   - Updated template_system.md with test generation details
   - Added troubleshooting information to testing_and_improvements.md
   - Consolidated findings in master_plan.md

4. Test Generation Fixes and Version Control Updates
   - Updated test_generator.py to handle both dictionary and string format requirements
   - Added TestAgent configuration to agents.yaml for testing requirement validation
   - Modified .gitignore to allow tracking of private/config files
   - Committed and pushed changes with detailed commit message
   - Improved error handling for requirement verification
   - Added comprehensive test cases for requirement validation

## üéØ Next Actions

1. System Deployment (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Run full test suite to verify fixes
   - Deploy updated system with new requirement handling
   - Monitor system performance
   - Begin agent interactions
   - Document any issues encountered

2. Regression Testing
   - Run comprehensive test suite
   - Verify requirement inheritance chain
   - Test all capability interactions
   - Monitor system stability
   - Document test results

The system is containerized and operational, but requires test generation fixes before proceeding with agent deployment. The next chat session should focus on investigating the agent class implementation and requirement handling.
