## Phase 3: Advanced Agent Capabilities (Next)

### 1. Code Analysis
1. Static Analysis
   ```python
   class CodeAnalyzer:
       def analyze_code(self, code: str) -> Analysis:
           # Perform static code analysis
           # Check code quality
           # Identify potential issues
   ```

2. Pattern Recognition
   ```python
   class PatternMatcher:
       def find_patterns(self, code: str) -> List[Pattern]:
           # Identify code patterns
           # Match against best practices
           # Suggest improvements
   ```

### 2. Automated Testing
1. Test Generation
   ```python
   class TestGenerator:
       def generate_tests(self, code: str) -> List[Test]:
           # Analyze code structure
           # Generate test cases
           # Create test suites
   ```

2. Test Execution
   ```python
   class TestRunner:
       async def run_tests(self, tests: List[Test]) -> TestResults:
           # Set up test environment
           # Execute test cases
           # Generate reports
   ```

### 3. Code Improvement
1. Refactoring Engine
   ```python
   class Refactorer:
       def suggest_refactoring(self, code: str) -> List[Suggestion]:
           # Identify refactoring opportunities
           # Generate improvement suggestions
           # Provide code examples
   ```

2. Code Generator
   ```python
   class CodeGenerator:
       def generate_code(self, spec: Dict) -> str:
           # Parse specifications
           # Generate code structure
           # Apply patterns and best practices
   ```

### 4. Integration Testing
1. Test Cases
   ```python
   class IntegrationTests:
       async def test_agent_capabilities(self):
           # Test code analysis
           # Test pattern matching
           # Test refactoring
   ```

2. Performance Tests
   ```python
   class PerformanceTests:
       async def test_system_performance(self):
           # Test response times
           # Test resource usage
           # Test concurrent operations
   ```

## Next Chat Prompt
```
I need help implementing advanced agent capabilities for code analysis and improvement. We've completed:

1. Agent-project integration with:
   - Project-agent associations
   - Operation tracking
   - Capability execution

2. Real-time monitoring with:
   - WebSocket updates
   - Operation queuing
   - Performance tracking
   - Monitoring dashboard

Now we need to add code analysis capabilities:
1. Implement static code analysis
2. Add pattern recognition
3. Create test generation
4. Build refactoring engine

Can you help implement the code analysis system starting with the static analyzer?
```

This prompt provides:
1. Clear context of completed work
2. Specific next implementation goals
3. Detailed requirements for code analysis
4. Focus on static analysis first
