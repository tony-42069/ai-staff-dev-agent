# AI Staff Development Agent

A sophisticated framework for creating and managing AI development agents. This project provides core intelligence capabilities for agent creation, project generation, code generation, and development task management.

## Features

- **Core Intelligence Engine**: Manages agent configurations and capabilities
- **Agent Factory**: Creates new AI agents with customizable capabilities
- **Agent Manager**: Handles agent lifecycle and execution
- **Template System**: Generates agent code and configuration files
- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive unit tests for core functionality
