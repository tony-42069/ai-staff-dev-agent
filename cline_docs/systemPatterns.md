# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
1. Core Intelligence Engine
   * Handles agent reasoning and decision making
   * Manages task execution
   * Processes user requests
2. Agent Generation System
   * Creates new AI agents
   * Configures agent capabilities
   * Sets up agent environments
3. Development Task System
   * Handles project generation
   * Manages code generation
   * Executes development operations

## Key Technical Decisions
1. Modular architecture for extensibility
2. Separation of core intelligence from agent capabilities
3. Template-based approach for agent generation
4. Task-oriented system for development operations

## Design Patterns
1. Modular Design Pattern
   * Separates core functionality into independent modules
2. Template Pattern
   * Uses templates for agent generation and project creation
3. Task Chain Pattern
   * Executes development tasks in a sequential chain
4. Capability Pattern
   * Implements agent features as independent capabilities
